A distribuição inicial do alvo revela um desequilíbrio natural, com uma maior quantidade de alunos que completam ou continuam seus estudos.\n",

        "Para adequar a questão ao propósito institucional de detectar estudantes em risco de desistência, o alvo foi alterado para uma variável binária. Nesse novo formato, a categoria Evasão foi designada como classe positiva (1), enquanto Graduado e Matriculado foram combinados como classe negativa (0).\n",

        "Depois dessa mudança, notou-se uma diminuição significativa na proporção da classe positiva, reduzindo de cerca de 32,1% na configuração original para 14,4% na variável binária efetivamente utilizada para o treinamento. Essa alteração destaca o desequilíbrio entre as classes, o que justifica a aplicação de métodos como o balanceamento de classes no modelo e a adoção de métricas além da simples acurácia."

Após as mudanças, nota-se uma melhoria geral nas métricas, o que sugere uma diminuição de vieses e um melhor equilíbrio no desempenho do modelo entre grupos distintos. Essa progressão indica que as técnicas implementadas ajudaram a tornar o modelo mais equitativo, sem afetar sua eficácia de forma significativa."

Desse modo, a base se revelou fundamental não só para antecipar a evasão, mas também para auxiliar na tomada de decisões mais justas e responsáveis no âmbito educacional."
